# Prime-numbers-between-two-inputs
The program asks the user for the 'first number' and the 'second number' and prints all prime numbers between them.
At first, there is a while loop examining all odd numbers in the range to ensure that it is  prime
and there is a condition to print 2 if the start number is less than or equal 2
_because all prime numbers are odd except 2_
then there is a prime1() function to know if the input is prime or not.
and it divides the input by all odd numbers that are less than the square root of the input
_a theory in the number theory (x is prime when x hasn't a prime divisor <= âˆšx)_
